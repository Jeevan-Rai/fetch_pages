# fetch_pages

A Flutter package that leverages `json_dynamic_widget` to dynamically render pages from JSON data. This package fetches all the pages from a server when the app launches and provides a function to get a specific page by its name. It also caches the fetched data using `SharedPreferences`.

## Features

- Fetch pages from a server and store them locally.
- Retrieve and render pages dynamically using `json_dynamic_widget`.
- Cache the fetched data for offline usage.
- Simple API to get a page by its name.
- Display a loading indicator while the page data is being fetched.
- Handle page-specific data via the `RenderPage` widget.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- `http` package
- `logger` package
- `shared_preferences` package
- `json_dynamic_widget` package

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.3
  logger: ^1.0.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.6
  json_dynamic_widget: ^4.0.0
```

### API Response Format

The API should return JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "pageName1": { /* page_json */ },
  "pageName2": { /* page_json */ },
  // more pages...
}
```

## Usage

### Fetching Pages from API

To fetch pages from the API and store them locally:

```dart
import 'package:fetch_pages/fetch_pages.dart';

void main() async {
  String apiUrl = 'https://your-api-url.com/pages';
  await FetchPages.fetchPagesFromAPI(apiUrl);
}
```

### Getting a Page by Name

To get a specific page by its name:

```dart
String? pageJson = await FetchPages.getPageByName('page_name');
if (pageJson != null) {
  // Use the pageJson to render the page using json_dynamic_widget
}
```

### Rendering a Page

To render a page using the `RenderPage` widget, ensure your map format is as follows:

```json
{
  "pageName": "pagename",
  "data": {
    "key": "value",
    // more key-value pairs...
  }
}
```

Here's an example of how to use the `RenderPage` widget with your page data:

```dart
import 'package:fetch_pages/fetch_pages.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:json_dynamic_widget/json_dynamic_widget.dart';

final navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FetchPages.fetchPagesFromAPI("http://your-api-url.com/pages");
  JsonWidgetRegistry registry = JsonWidgetRegistry.instance;
  registry.navigatorKey = navigatorKey;

  // you can define custom widgets and registry functions here.

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: "Render Page",
      initialRoute: '/home',
      routes: {
        '/home': (context) =>
            const RenderPage(pageData: {"pageName": "index.json"}), 
            /* 
              you can also add page data that is to be added to registry, 
                example: 
                  {
                    "pageName": "index.json", 
                    "data": {
                      "title":"Hello there", 
                      ... 
                    }
                  }
            */
      },
      navigatorKey: navigatorKey,
    );
  }
}
```
